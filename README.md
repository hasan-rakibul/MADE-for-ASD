**Abstract:** In response to the global need for efficient early diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), we aim to bridge the gap between traditional, time-consuming diagnostic methods and potential automated solutions. To this end, we propose a multi-atlas deep ensemble network, **MADE-for-ASD**, that integrates multiple atlases of the brain's functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data through a weighted deep ensemble network. We further integrate demographic information into the prediction workflow, which enhances ASD detection accuracy and offers a more holistic perspective on patient profiling. We experiment with the well-known publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE), consisting of resting state fMRI data from 17 different laboratories around the globe. Our proposed system achieves an accuracy of 75.2% on the whole dataset and 96.40% on a subset â€“ both surpassing the reported ASD detection performances in the literature. The proposed system can potentially pave the way for more cost-effective, efficient and scalable strategies in ASD diagnosis. Codes and evaluations are publicly available at https://github.com/hasan-rakibul/MADE-for-ASD.

## Environment Setup

Please be aware that this code is meant to be run with Python 3 under Linux (MacOS may work, Windows probably not). Download the packages from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We use the [ABIDE I dataset](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/). We use the pre-processing method from the [preprocessed-connectomes-project](https://github.com/preprocessed-connectomes-project/abide).


## Run Experiments

We put all the experiment command and the result in the `Experiments.ipynb` file. As an example, we prepare the hdf5 files in advance of the CC200, AAL, EZ atlas data from the NYU site, and show the entire experiment on this data as followings:

1. Run `download_abide.py` to download the raw data.

We use the command below:

```bash
#download_abide.py [--pipeline=cpac] [--strategy=filt_global] [<derivative> ...]
python download_abide.py
```

2. To show the demographic Information of ABIDE I.

```bash
python pheno_info.py
```

3. Run `prepare_data.py` to compute the correlation. Then we can get the hdf5 files. The dataset (hdf5) can be downloaded from [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-WyQ7IOqSxaGcoA6MR4ydJdazlqzKYMY/view?usp=drive_link); you need to put it in the "data" folder. Or you can simply run the code as:

```bash
#download_abide.py [--folds=N] [--whole] [--male] [--threshold] [--leave-site-out] [--NYU-site-out] [<derivative> ...]

python prepare_data.py --folds=10 --whole cc200 aal ez
```

4. Using Stacked Sparse Denoising Autoencoder (SSDAE) to perform Multi-atlas Deep Feature Representation, and using multilayer perceptron (MLP) and ensemble learning to classify the ASD and TC.

```bash
#nn.py [--whole] [--male] [--threshold] [--leave-site-out] [<derivative> ...]

rm ./data/models/*mlp*
python nn.py --whole cc200 aal ez
```  

5. Evaluating the MLP model on test dataset. You can use the saved models from provious or download the models from the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rIZpXdafzI-nb0YonkL0XQs6pOSSxRUf?usp=drive_link), and **can run this command directly without running previous steps**.

```bash
#nn_evaluate.py [--whole] [--male] [--threshold] [--leave-site-out] [--NYU-site-out] [<derivative> ...]

python nn_evaluate.py --whole cc200 aal ez
```
        
## Quality Analysis and Visualisation

All the analysis for the subset and the visualisation of top ROIs, which mentioned in our work, are included in the `analysis_and_visulaisation.ipynb` file.
